# Minesweeper
A simple minesweeper game played in the terminal. Right now it's super basic but I may add some more features in the future. Also my first c++ "project".

# Installation
Just go to releases and download the latest version for your os. There's no version for mac as of now.

# How to play
You'll get a 9x9 grid and there are nine mines. You can input the row and column and whether to flag or mine that cell. If you don't know how to play minesweeper then look at the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) article.

What the different symbols mean:

  \# - Cell is covered
  
  X - Cell is flagged
  
  A number - number of neighboring mines
